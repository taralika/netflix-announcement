            <h1>Netflix Introduces "Nostalgia Tax" for Gen X and Millennial Viewers</h1>
            
            <p>LOS GATOS, CA — Netflix announced today a new pricing structure called the "Nostalgia Tax" that will affect subscribers born between 1975 and 1995. Starting May 1, 2025, viewers will be charged an additional $5 monthly fee for accessing content that originally aired during their high school and college years.</p>
            
            <p>The decision comes after extensive data analysis revealed that subscribers in their late 30s to mid-40s spend approximately 70% of their viewing time rewatching series from the 1990s and early 2000s, with "Friends," "The Office," "Seinfeld," and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" topping the list of most repeatedly streamed content.</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                <p>"Our algorithms have detected a significant pattern we're calling 'comfort streaming,' where subscribers consistently return to the same shows they watched in their formative years rather than exploring our newer original content," said Miranda Wells, Netflix's newly appointed Chief Nostalgia Officer. "The Midlife Algorithm Adjustment is designed to both monetize this behavior and gently encourage viewers to broaden their streaming horizons."</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The Nostalgia Tax will be automatically applied to accounts whose viewing history indicates more than 50 hours per quarter spent on content that premiered when the account holder was between the ages of 14 and 22. Netflix has developed a proprietary "Formative Years Detection System" that can determine which shows align with a subscriber's peak nostalgia period based on their date of birth and viewing patterns.</p>
            
            <p>Subscribers can opt out of the Nostalgia Tax by taking the "New Content Challenge," which requires completing at least five recently released Netflix Original series within a three-month period. Those who successfully diversify their viewing habits will receive a "Contemporary Viewer Certification" and have the fee waived for six months.</p>
            
            <p>Industry analysts predict the new fee structure could generate up to $400 million in additional annual revenue for the streaming giant, while also addressing what executives have termed "the Ross and Rachel rewatch crisis."</p>
